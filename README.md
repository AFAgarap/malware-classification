## Abstract
Effective and efficient mitigation of malware is a long-time endeavor in the information security community.
The development of an anti-malware system that can counteract previously-unknown malware is a prolific activity that
may benefit several sectors. We envision an intelligent anti-malware system that utilizes the power of deep learning
(DL) models. Using such models would enable the detection of newly-released malware through mathematical generalization.
That is, finding the relationship between a given malware *x* and its corresponding malware family *y*, *f : x → y*.
To accomplish this feat, we used the Malimg dataset[[12](http://old.vision.ece.ucsb.edu/spam/malimg.shtml)] which
consists of malware images that were processed from malware binaries, and then we trained the following DL models 1 to
classify each malware family: CNN-SVM[[16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0239)],
GRU-SVM[[3](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03082)], and MLP-SVM. Empirical evidence has shown that the GRU-SVM stands out
among the DL models with a predictive accuracy of ≈84.92%. This stands to reason for the mentioned model had the
relatively most sophisticated architecture design among the presented models. The exploration of an even more optimal
DL-SVM model is the next stage towards the engineering of an intelligent anti-malware system.

## Dataset

To use the dataset from this repository, you can intall [`pt-datasets`](https://github.com/afagarap/pt-datasets),

```shell script
$ pip install pt-datasets
```

## Usage
First, clone the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AFAgarap/malware-classification.git/
```

Run the `setup.sh` to ensure that the pre-requisite libraries are installed in the environment.
```bash
$ sudo chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

Run the `main.py` with the following parameters.
```bash
usage: main.py [-h] -m MODEL -d DATASET -n NUM_EPOCHS -c PENALTY_PARAMETER -k
               CHECKPOINT_PATH -l LOG_PATH -r RESULT_PATH

For instance, use the CNN-SVM model.
```bash
$ cd malware-classification
$ python3 main.py --model 1 --dataset ./dataset/malimg.npz --num_epochs 100 --penalty_parameter 10 --checkpoint_path ./checkpoint/ --log_path ./logs/ --result_path ./results/
```

To run a trained model, run the `classifier.py` with the following parameters.
```bash
usage: classifier.py [-h] -m MODEL -t MODEL_PATH -d DATASET
